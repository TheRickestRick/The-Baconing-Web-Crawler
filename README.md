# The-Baconing-Web-Crawler
The Kevin Bacon search app was built to find how many degrees of separation there are between any given actor, and Kevin Bacon. The app works by scraping data off of IMDB's website. We start with Kevin Baconâ€™s page, and pull all of the movies that he has been in, along with all of the other cast members in those movies. The app makes use of promises while doing this, and also uses a queue array to continually search until we find our search term. The queue will keep track of all of the movies, and cast members we are making calls to because we .pop() off the last item in the queue to make the next call in the search. We also have a parent relationship object that we can store the parent nodes in, so when we do locate the actor in question, we will know how they are connected to Kevin Bacon. So after we traverse through our queue array, and find the actor, we just display the parent nodes that we used to find them. This way we can find the degrees of separation between our search actor and Kevin Bacon.
